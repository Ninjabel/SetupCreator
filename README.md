# SetupCreator

SetupCreator is a web application that allows users to create their own computer configurations while also providing access to information about the cheapest available components on the Polish market. The application scrapes data from an external service offering the lowest prices for computer parts. After selecting a component, users have the option to visit the store where its price is the lowest.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

- **SetupCreator - backend**: a server based on Node.js and Express, responsible for the application's logic and data management.
- **SetupCreator - frontend**: a user interface created using Angular, providing a friendly and intuitive environment for creating and viewing computer configurations.

## Requirements

Before starting the project, make sure the following tools are installed on your computer:

- Node.js (along with npm)
- Angular CLI

## Launching the Project

To launch the project, you need to separately start the backend and frontend parts. Instructions for launching are found in the README.md files in the respective folders (`SetupCreator - backend` and `SetupCreator - frontend`).
